# Final-Year-Project
Final year project (Semester 2 2019)

Product idea: 
The idea behing this project is to find an available parking space in Victoria city by extracting real-time parking data from https://opendata.victoria.ca/ which can help users efficiently find an available parking space in the city. Several Google Cloud products were used to develop the back-end of the application. Android platform was used to code the front-end of the application. A very complex architecture of the application was deemed too heavy to be completed in time. Some big features are still undeveloped due to time constraint. SPRINT methodology was used throughout the development of the project.

Role in the project: 
- Front-end developer 
- System architecture 
- System analysis
- Usability testing 
- Database
