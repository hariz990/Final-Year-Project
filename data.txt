The nosql cloudstore database consists of three collections:
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/avid-invention-249406/database/firestore/data~2FListing~2FW1XPGpYlr2MnpUNhhcDY

Booking: Contains each registered carpark booking when arranged through the app. Fields include - "uid" (which is the same uid as the customers user account), "address", "availability", "email". This is called by the BookingActivity.java class and the BookingRecyclerViewAdapter.java class respectively from the core Android application.

Listing: Contains each registered carpark listed by a leaser. Currently leasers interact directly with the database through the console - https://console.firebase.google.com/project/avid-invention-249406/database/firestore/data~2FListing~2FW1XPGpYlr2MnpUNhhcDY
A feature to give leasers applicaiton control of the database listings is in development. Fields include - "uid" (which is the same uid as the customers user account), "address", "availability". This is called by the SearchL:istingActivity.java class and the ListingRecyclerViewAdapter.java class respectively from the core Android application.

User: Contains the core user details established during rthe registration process on the applicaiton. It included both customer and leaser users. the uid established here is shared with relavant bookings and listings. Fields include - "uid", "email", "firstname", "lastname", "isLeaser", "rego", "username". This is created in the RegistrationActivity.java class and is referenced in LoginActivity.java class and also in the previously mentioned classes to provided identity hooks.
